# Fluidity
This is my attempt at an physics engine for a game that had currently (2019-10-15) played for a total of 14 hours. I like it very much and I want to see how it would behave with a multithreaded physics engine that more closely simulates real physics. I'd like to add a few things like infrared radiation, faster gas movement, convection and better simulate interactions currently missing from the game like water not boiling in vaccum when it is at like 80 degrees celsius and so on.

It might take me a while before I finish this if I finish it at all as I do this in my spare time. Klei might also beat me to it (which I somewhat doubt, since the game is considered feature complete and has launched).

This was also an excellent opportunity for me to dip my toes in C# and Unity development which is a thing that I have wanted to do for some time. This game and the challenge was what pushed me to start this thing and I'm also confident enough as a developer to get going.
